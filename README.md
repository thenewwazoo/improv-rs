This is a quick and dirty implementation of [Improv](https://www.improv-wifi.com) in Rust.

I basically just use it right now to bootstrap connected devices I'm developing that are running the
Serial C++ code, in order to exercise the web-flasher-based provisioning without having to go
clicky-clicky-clicky.
